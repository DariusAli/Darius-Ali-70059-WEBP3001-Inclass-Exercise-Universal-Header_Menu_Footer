                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This project document is based on a Supermaket Inventory Management System.
                The system that is currently in use is a paper based system. The client, Chen's Supermarket wishes
                to switch to a computer based system to increase the productivity of the supermarket's warehouse 
                department.
